FTCPlanner:
  max_x_vel: 0.7 # The maximal velocity at forward direction in m/s. The planner tries to reach this velocity as fast as possible.
  max_rotation_vel: 0.8 #  (double)The maximal rotation velocity in rad/s. The planner tries to reach this velocity as fast as possible.
  min_rotation_vel: 0.05 #  (double)The minimal rotation velocity in rad/s. Used to guarantee a rotation towards the goal orientation.
  acceleration_x: 0.4 #  (double)The acceleration limit of the robot in the x direction (m/s^2).
  acceleration_z: 0.8 #  (double)The acceleration limit of the robot for a rotation.
  position_accuracy: 0.3 #(double)The accuracy of the robot at the goal position. Maximal distance to the goal position in meter.
  rotation_accuracy: 0.1 #  (double)The maximal allowed angle the robot differs from the goal orientation in radian.
  slow_down_factor: 0 # (double)A factor to influence the rotation deceleration. It should compensate inaccuracies at the motor control. If the slow_down_factor > 0 the deceleration starts later.
  sim_time: 1.0 #  (double)The time in seconds to look along the global plan with maximal velocity, to calculate the path.
  local_planner_frequence: 10 # (int) Needs to be set to the same value as the local planner frequency (controller_frequency) in move base.
  join_obstacle: false # (bool)If true, local and global costmaps are joined. Local obstacles will be bypassed.
